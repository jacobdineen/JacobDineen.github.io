## Hobbies and Interests

I am an avid sports fan and am basking in the Sun's recent success (2021). In my spare time, I'm usually planning trips to explore the world with my girlfriend, getting together with the guys or my family, memorizing IMDB catalogues, tinkering with my computers or speakers, or finding some way to be active in the Arizona heat.
