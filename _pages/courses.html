In many economic or game-theoretic applications, the problem either lacks sufficient data or is too complex. In such cases, machine learning theory helps to design more realistic or practical algorithms. Conversely, in many applications of machine learning or prediction, we have to obtain data from self-interested agents whose objectives are not aligned with the system designer. In those settings, the algorithms have to take into account these agents' strategic behaviors. These problems form an intriguing interplay between machine learning and game theory, and have attracted a lot of recent research attention. This course will discuss several recent research directions in this space. Our goal is to cover (some selected) basic results in the following two directions. En route, we will also develop necessary basics of game theory, learning theory, mechanism design, and information elicitation."
